## Python 3.11 Alpha

A new version of Python is released in October each year. The code is developed and tested over a [seventeen-month period](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/) before the release date. New features are implemented during the [alpha phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha), which lasts until May, about five months before the final release.
