## Python 3.11 Alpha

A new version of Python is released in October each year. The code is developed and tested over a [seventeen-month period](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/) before the release date. New features are implemented during the [alpha phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha), which lasts until May, about five months before the final release.

About [once a month](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0664/) during the alpha phase, Pythonâ€™s core developers release a new **alpha version** to show off the new features, test them, and get early feedback. Currently, the latest version of Python 3.11 is **3.11.0 alpha 5**, released on February 3, 2022.

The first **beta release** of Python 3.11 is planned for May 6, 2022. Typically, no new features are added during the [beta phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta). Instead, the time between the feature freeze and the release date is used to test and solidify the code.
